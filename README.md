_The authors argue that environmentalist alarmism of the likes propounded by the Marxist extremist group "Extinction Rebellion" are essentially fantastical simulations of the end of the world that provide an outlet for frustration and anxiety about real problems stemming from political oppression and social decline._

_A comparison of millenarian beliefs in the Christian paradigm to beliefs in the end of the world espoused by climate activists, including the propensity of such fear-mongering rhetoric to incite destructive and violent responses by justifying any such means for the ostensible end of "saving the world" from theological or ecological doom._

**Introduction**

The analogy between fundamentalist Judeo-Christian millenarianism, wherein religious texts are interpreted as infallible proclamations of the end of the world replete with specific dates and locations, and the equally zealous proclamations by climate alarmists of a world-ending catastrophy precipitated by the errant judgment of mankind, for which he is punished by nature as if by God, has become so obvious as to constitute something of a running joke for many people. However, the irrational and unquestioning acceptance of such dogma by its most zealous adherents often belies the seriousness of the issue on which it is based - to our knowledge, the world is in fact going to end, one way or another, and we would be just as irrational as the most ridiculous climate agitators to be entirely unconcerned about it. While most "solutions" offered by the cynical puppeteers of the climate industry are at best ineffective and at worst contrary to their stated aims, real solutions do exist and have garnered the attention of a rapidly increasing contingent of the elite whose willingness and ability to engage with the issue in practical terms is fostering the emergence of a realistic alternative to the endless cycles of unrestrained growth and managed decline that have informed the trajectory of our civilization for far too long. The focus of this paper will be on the inadequacy of this latter model as exemplified by the likeness of contemporary environmentalist rhetoric to that of fundamentalist religion, with some attention paid to novel alternatives to the problem of human survival and the depletion or destruction of natural resources.
